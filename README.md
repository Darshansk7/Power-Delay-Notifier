## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: MySQL with connection pooling
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with bcrypt password hashing
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP
- **Frontend**: Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Fetch API
- **Validation**: Express-validator for input sanitization
- **Security**: Helmet.js for HTTP headers, CORS protection

### Node.js Role in the System
Node.js serves as the runtime environment that powers the entire backend infrastructure. It handles concurrent requests through its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it ideal for managing multiple technician connections and simultaneous email broadcasts. The Express.js framework provides the web server capabilities, middleware support, and routing system that enables the RESTful API architecture.

## üîê Authentication System

### JWT (JSON Web Token) Implementation
The system uses JWT for stateless authentication. When a technician logs in successfully, the server generates a JWT token containing the technician's ID and role. This token is stored in the browser's localStorage and sent with every subsequent request in the Authorization header. The middleware validates the token on protected routes and extracts the technician information for database operations.

### Password Security with Bcrypt
All passwords are hashed using bcryptjs before storage in the database. Bcrypt provides salt generation and adaptive hashing, making it resistant to rainbow table attacks and brute force attempts. The system uses a cost factor of 12 for optimal security-performance balance.

### Two-Tier Technician Management
The system implements a sophisticated two-list approach for technician management:

1. **Valid Technicians List**: Pre-approved technicians stored in the `valid_technicians` table with Tech ID, name, email, and department information. This list is managed by the department and serves as the master list of authorized personnel.

2. **Registered Technicians List**: Active users who have completed the registration process, stored in the `registered_technicians` table with Tech ID, email, hashed password, and name. Only technicians from the valid list can register and become active users.

### Authentication Flow
1. Technician enters Tech ID and password on the login form
2. System validates Tech ID exists in registered technicians table
3. Password is compared against bcrypt-hashed stored password
4. Upon successful authentication, JWT token is generated and returned
5. Token is stored in localStorage and used for subsequent API calls
6. Protected routes validate token using middleware before processing requests

## üìß Gmail Integration and Email Broadcasting

### SMTP Configuration
The system integrates with Gmail's SMTP service using Nodemailer. The configuration includes:
- SMTP Host: smtp.gmail.com
- Port: 587 (TLS)
- Authentication: Gmail username and App Password
- Security: TLS encryption for all email communications

### App Password Setup
Gmail requires App Passwords for SMTP authentication when 2-Step Verification is enabled. The system uses these App Passwords instead of regular account passwords to ensure secure email delivery and avoid authentication issues.

### Email Broadcasting Mechanism
When a technician sends a notification:
1. System queries the database for all customers in the target area
2. Creates a professional HTML email template with technician details
3. Sends individual emails to each customer using Nodemailer
4. Logs the notification details in the database
5. Returns success/failure statistics to the technician

### Email Template Features
- Professional HTML formatting with company branding
- Technician name and timestamp for accountability
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop viewing
- Clear power delay information and estimated restoration times
- Contact information for additional support

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Architecture and Operations

### Database Schema Design
The system uses MySQL with a well-structured relational database design:

1. **customers table**: Stores customer registration data with unique email constraints
2. **valid_technicians table**: Pre-approved technician list with Tech ID and department information
3. **registered_technicians table**: Active technician accounts with hashed passwords
4. **technician_areas table**: Many-to-many relationship linking technicians to their assigned areas
5. **notifications table**: Audit trail of all sent notifications with recipient counts

### Data Storage and Retrieval Patterns
- **Connection Pooling**: Uses mysql2/promise for efficient database connections
- **Parameterized Queries**: Prevents SQL injection attacks
- **Transaction Support**: Ensures data consistency during complex operations
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Maintains referential integrity between tables
- **Indexing**: Optimized queries for Tech ID and email lookups

### Database Operations Flow
1. **Customer Registration**: Validates unique email, stores in customers table
2. **Technician Registration**: Validates against valid_technicians list, hashes password, stores in registered_technicians
3. **Area Assignment**: Removes existing assignments, inserts new area assignments in technician_areas table
4. **Notification Sending**: Queries customers by area, sends emails, logs notification details
5. **Authentication**: Validates Tech ID and password against registered_technicians table

## üì° Broadcasting and Notification System

### Real-time Notification Delivery
The system implements an efficient broadcasting mechanism that:
- Identifies all customers in the target geographic area
- Generates personalized email content for each recipient
- Sends emails concurrently using Nodemailer's promise-based API
- Tracks delivery statistics and success rates
- Provides immediate feedback to technicians on notification status

### Area-based Targeting
The system supports seven predefined areas (chickpete, balepete, akkipete, kumbarpete, chamrajpete, nagarthpete, cubbonpete) that technicians can be assigned to. When sending notifications, technicians can only target areas they are responsible for, ensuring proper authorization and accountability.

### Notification Tracking and Analytics
Every notification is logged with:
- Target area and message content
- Recipient count and delivery statistics
- Sending technician information
- Timestamp for audit purposes
- Success/failure status for each email
